        <u><h1>Introduction to MeltedForge</h1></u>
        <br>
        <p>
            MeltedForge is game engine which is currently under development. <br>
            It is written in the language C. Additional info on the development is in the Github repository. <br>
            The Github repo repository is <a href="https://github.com/CloudCodingSpace/MeltedForge">here</a>.

        <u><h1>Goals and Current Status</h1></u>
        <br>
        <p>
            MeltedForge is aimed to be cross-platform (Desktop platforms) and hopefully be able to export games. <br>
            In the foreseeable future, MeltedForge is aimed to give it's client developers 2 options :- <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a game using the engine's editor. Or,</li>
                <li>Create a game directly in C using the engine's core as a 3rd party library in cmake.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the engine doesn't have many features and there is no editor as of now. <br>
            The engine is still at a very early stage, in fact not even close to the first alpha release. <br>
            The engine is currently only being developed and being tested on Windows. But intentions are their for Linux support too. <br>
