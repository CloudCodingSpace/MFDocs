                <br>
                <p>
                    MeltedForge is game engine which is currently under development. <br>
                    It is written in the language C. Additional info on the development can be found in the Github repository. <br>
                    The Github repo repository is <a href="https://github.com/CloudCodingSpace/MeltedForge">here</a>.

                <u><h1>Goals and Current Status</h1></u>
                <br>
                <p>
                    MeltedForge is aimed to be cross-platform (Desktop platforms) and hopefully be able to export games. <br>
                    In the foreseeable future, MeltedForge is aimed to give its client developers 2 options :- <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a game using the engine's editor. Or,</li>
                        <li>Create a game directly in C using the engine's core as a 3rd party library in CMake.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the engine doesn't have many features and there is no editor as of now. <br>
                    The engine is still at a very early stage, in fact not even close to the first alpha release. <br>
                    The engine is currently only being developed and being tested on Windows. But intentions are there for Linux support too. <br>
