# MFDocs
This repo contains the documentation web pages written in markdown files for
MeltedForge. (Github repo is [here](https://github.com/CloudCodingSpace/MeltedForge))

## Suggestions and contributions
If any typos, errors or grammartical issues spotted, then a pull request is much appreciated.
Web development along with CSS and designing is quite a weak spot for me (@CloudCodingSpace),
so any suggestions on the design, style or improvements are always welcome.
