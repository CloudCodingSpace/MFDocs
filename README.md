# MFDocs
This repo contains the documentation web pages written in markdown files for
MeltedForge. (Github repo is [here](https://github.com/CloudCodingSpace/MeltedForge))

## Suggestions and contributions
If any typos, errors or grammartical issues spotted, then a pull request is much appreciated.
To be honest, designing and writing documentation is quite a weak spot for me. So, any suggestions on the 
design, style or improvements are always welcome.

## Site generators
This website is possible by mkdocs with material theme. It is a wonderful static site generators which
helped converting markdown files to html. Mkdocs has quite nice features like language syntax linting,
emojs, etc.
