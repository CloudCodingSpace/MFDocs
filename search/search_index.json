It was first started as a simple hobby engine. But slowly, the aim wasn't anymore to be a \"hobby\" engine. As a game engine, we want it to be like a proper 2d/3d game engine which can actually export fun and enjoyable games. We admit it sounds ambitious and like any other \"wannabe\" engine. But still we continue to work to make  goal a reality.</p> <p>The entire code is open sourced. The github repository is here. One of the main reason it is open sourced is first of all, we feel like open source projects is a great learning resource for other devs and secondly, the option for community suggestions is open. Which in our opinion, a good thing since it helps point out bugs, certain inconsistencies and enrich ideas from various minds all over the world.</p>"},{"location":"#goals","title":"Goals","text":"<p>We want to give our client developer 2 main options :-  - Either create a game using the engine's editor (Not yet started the editor)  - Or, manually write your app natively in C/C++ by directly interacting with the engine's core.</p> <p>We recommend the second option for devs who have prior experience with low-level systems and want more customization and flexibility without any bloat.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>This website is the documentation site for MeltedForge. Since other devs, need some sort of valid documents which would guide them in their journey using MeltedForge instead of manually reading the entire engine's source code and figuring it out themselves.</p> <p>This website is made using Material for MkDocs as the site generator. Also, the code for this website is hosted on github. We are open to any suggestion and improvements which would help making MeltedForge a better engine.</p>"}]}
