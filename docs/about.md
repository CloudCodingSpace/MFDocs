# **About**

This website is the documentation site for MeltedForge. Since other devs, need some sort of valid
documents which would guide them in their journey using MeltedForge instead of manually reading the entire
engine's source code and figuring it out themselves.

This website is made using Material for MkDocs as the site generator. Also, the code for this website is hosted on
[github](https://github.com/CloudCodingSpace/MFDocs). We are open to any suggestion and improvements which would help
making MeltedForge a better engine.
