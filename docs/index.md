# MeltedForge

MeltedForge is game engine written in the C language. It was first started as a simple
hobby engine. But slowly, the aim wasn't anymore to be a "hobby" engine. As a game engine,
we want it to be like a proper 2d/3d game engine. Sounds ambitious? Yes.

The entire code is open sourced. The github repository is [here](https://github.com/CloudCodingSpace/MeltedForge).
One of the main reason it is open sourced is first of all, We feel like open source projects helps a lot to learn
other devs and secondly, the option for community suggestions is open. Which in our opinion, a good thing since
it helps point out bugs, certain inconsistencies and enrich ideas from various minds all over the world.
