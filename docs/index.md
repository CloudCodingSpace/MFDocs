# MeltedForge

MeltedForge is game engine written in the C language. It was first started as a simple
hobby engine. But slowly, the aim wasn't anymore to be a "hobby" engine. As a game engine,
we want it to be like a proper 2d/3d game engine which can actually export fun and enjoyable games.
We admit it sounds ambitious and like any other "wannabe" engine. But still we continue work to make 
it a reality.

The entire code is open sourced. The github repository is [here](https://github.com/CloudCodingSpace/MeltedForge).
One of the main reason it is open sourced is first of all, we feel like open source projects is a great learning resource
for other devs and secondly, the option for community suggestions is open. Which in our opinion, a good thing since
it helps point out bugs, certain inconsistencies and enrich ideas from various minds all over the world.

# Goals
We want to give our client developer 2 main options :-
 - Either create a game using the engine's editor (Not yet started the editor)
 - Or, manually write your app natively in C/C++ by directly interacting with the engine's core.

We recommend the second option for devs who have prior experience with low-level systems
and want more customization and flexibility without any bloat.
